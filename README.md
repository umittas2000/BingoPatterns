## Bingo

Bingo is a specific game of chance in which participants use cards or paper sheets, or card-minding device representations thereof, divided into horizontal and vertical spaces. Each space is designated by a letter and a number, and prizes are awarded on the basis of the letters and numbers on the card conforming to a pre-determined and pre-announced configuration of letters and numbers selected at random.

## Bingo Ball

A bingo ball is a ball imprinted with numbers and letters that is used in the selection process of a bingo game.

## Card

A card contains 24 numbered spaces and one free space (blank or it will have a number or the words “Free Space”), with which you play BINGO. The numbers are assigned at random on each card and are arranged in five columns of five numbers each by five rows (5 x 5 = 25 in total, which includes the blank square). The numbers in the B column are between 1 and 15, in the I column between 16 and 30, in the N column (containing four numbers and the free space) between 31 and 45, in the G column between 46 and 60, and in the O column between 61 and 75. Players have thousands of unique (unduplicated) cards to choose from. Most bingo cards used today are disposable and printed on newsprint type of paper. Hard cards are available but are not commonly used today.

## Pattern

A pattern is the shape you need to cover on your card with called out numbers. You only need the numbers that form the pattern to win the game. The most basic patterns are straight lines in a horizontal, vertical or diagonal direction. One popular pattern is the "blackout" or "coverall," where you have to cover the whole card to win.

## Purpose of this project!
To provide a mutli dimensional arrayList of numbers to help testing patterns and number of ball draws in limited scope for testing perspective.
